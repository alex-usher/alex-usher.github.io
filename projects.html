              <li><b>Improvements: </b>The website was messy when I took over, storing old versions of the website in its file tree. This was removed and the entire website
                tidied. The page templates are now being taken and converted to Django to allow for the addition of a members area onto the site.

              <li><b>Description: </b>A multilayer perceptron trained, using a genetic algorithm, to predict stock prices given a file containing historical stock data for a
                company (the training data). Coded in C and produced by a group of 4 members.</li>
              <li><b>Challenges: </b>For this project we had a very limited time scale - around 10 days - and so we had to choose an implementation that would be effective
                but also implementable within the given time period. We also had to choose suitable activation functions for the layers of the perceptron,
                so as to avoid vanishing gradients.</li>
              <li><b>Improvements: </b>An LSTM network would have been a more suitable choice of neural network for this application, but time constraints did not give time for this.
                We also wanted to let the genetic algorithm control the weight initialisation of the networks, since two networks with the same dimensions but
                different weights could have very different fitness scores.</li>

              <li><b>Description: </b>An Android application for managing finances easily, by defining budgets and their frequency, and adding transactions
                which can be categorised into a particular budget.</li>
              <li><b>Challenges: </b>This was the first time I had used SQLite databases with Android, so it took a little bit of research to learn the required syntaxes
                and get the database working how I desired. Although the overall design of the app isn't bad, it could certainly be improved - there are
                a few small issues in the core design here and there that I could have avoided if I redid the whole project now.</li>
              <li><b>Improvements: </b>I revisited the application primarily because I knew it was a little messy and that the database structure could be improved - at the time
                I first made it I did not have enough experience to be able to structure it effectively. So on the revisit I significantly improved the database
                and also tidied some of the code, although I still feel areas handling dynamic content creation could be tidier.</li>

                                changed by the client, and that any maintenance could be carried out by OCM after the internship ended.</li>
